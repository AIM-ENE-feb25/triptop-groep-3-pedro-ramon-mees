## 4. Kwaliteitsattributen

Voordat deze casusomschrijving tot stand kwam, heeft de opdrachtgever de volgende ISO 25010 kwaliteitsattributen benoemd als belangrijk:

* Compatibility -> Interoperability (Degree to which a system, product or component can exchange information with other products and mutually use the information that has been exchanged)
* Reliability -> Fault Tolerance (Degree to which a system or component operates as intended despite the presence of hardware or software faults)
* Maintainability -> Modularity (Degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components)
* Maintainability -> Modifiability (Degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality)
* Security -> Integrity (Degree to which a system, product or component ensures that the state of its system and data are protected from unauthorized modification or deletion either by malicious action or computer error)
* Security -> Confidentiality (Degree to which a system, product or component ensures that data are accessible only to those authorized to have access)
