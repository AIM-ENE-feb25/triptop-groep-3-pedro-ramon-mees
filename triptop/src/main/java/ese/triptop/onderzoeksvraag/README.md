# API Architecture Design for Minimal Impact of API Changes

## Overview

This architecture is designed to minimize the impact of API changes on the application. It follows key design principles such as Encapsulation of What Varies, Single Responsibility Principle, Separation of Concerns, and Loose Coupling.

The architecture uses the Adapter pattern to isolate API-specific details, the Gateway pattern to provide a unified interface for API interactions, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to decouple external data formats from internal domain models.

## Components and Responsibilities

### 1. API Gateway
- Acts as a single entry point for all external API interactions
- Routes requests to appropriate API adapters
- Manages common concerns like error handling, retries, and logging
- Provides a unified interface for the application to interact with external services
- Decouples the application from direct knowledge of external API endpoints

### 2. API Adapters
- Implement a common interface for all API interactions
- Encapsulate service-specific details (endpoints, authentication, request/response formats)
- Handle conversion between external API formats and internal domain models
- Isolate changes in external APIs to a single component
- Enable easy substitution of different implementations

### 3. Configuration Manager
- Manages external configuration for API endpoints, credentials, etc.
- Centralizes configuration management
- Allows for runtime changes to configuration
- Supports different configurations for different environments

### 4. Domain Models
- Represent business entities and value objects
- Provide a consistent internal representation of data
- Decouple internal data structures from external API formats
- Enable business logic to operate on a stable data model regardless of API changes

### 5. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Represent data structures specific to external APIs
- Encapsulate the structure of requests and responses for external APIs
- Isolate changes in API data formats to a single component
- Facilitate clean mapping between external and internal data representations

### 6. Service Layer
- Implements business logic using API adapters
- Orchestrates calls to one or more API adapters
- Implements business rules and validations
- Transforms data between domain models and API-specific formats

## Interfaces

### API Adapter Interface
```java
public interface ApiAdapter<T, R> {
    R execute(T request) throws ApiException;
    String getServiceName();
    boolean isAvailable();
}
```

### API Gateway Interface
```java
public interface ApiGateway {
    <T, R> R executeApiCall(Class<? extends ApiAdapter<T, R>> adapterType, T request) throws ApiException;
    <T, R> ApiAdapter<T, R> getAdapter(Class<? extends ApiAdapter<T, R>> adapterType) throws ApiException;
}
```

### Configuration Manager Interface
```java
public interface ConfigurationManager {
    String getConfigValue(String key);
    String getConfigValue(String key, String defaultValue);
    void reloadConfiguration();
}
```

### Travel Service Interface
```java
public interface TravelService {
    List<HotelBookingOption> getHotelBookingOptions(HotelSearchCriteria searchCriteria) throws ServiceException;
    List<RestaurantRecommendation> getRestaurantRecommendations(Location location) throws ServiceException;
    List<FlightOffer> getFlightOffers(FlightSearchCriteria searchCriteria) throws ServiceException;
}
```

## Workflow

### Hotel Search Workflow
1. User enters search criteria in the frontend
2. Frontend sends request to backend API
3. TravelController calls TravelService.getHotelBookingOptions()
4. TravelService creates a HotelSearchRequest from the search criteria
5. TravelService calls ApiGateway.executeApiCall() with BookingAdapter
6. ApiGateway gets the BookingAdapter instance
7. ApiGateway calls BookingAdapter.execute() with the request
8. BookingAdapter makes HTTP request to Booking.com API
9. BookingAdapter parses the response into a HotelSearchResponse
10. BookingAdapter maps the response to domain objects
11. TravelService returns the domain objects to the controller
12. Controller returns the response to the frontend
13. Frontend displays the results to the user

### API Change Handling
When an API changes its response format:
1. Only the specific adapter for that API needs to be updated
2. The adapter continues to return the same domain objects
3. The service layer and above remain unchanged
4. The frontend continues to receive consistent data
5. The user experience remains consistent

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Isolation of API Changes**: Changes in external APIs only affect the corresponding adapter, not the entire application.
2. **Consistent Domain Model**: The application works with a stable domain model regardless of external API changes.
3. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock implementations.
4. **Flexibility**: New API providers can be added by implementing new adapters without changing the rest of the application.
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Encapsulation of What Varies**: API-specific details are encapsulated in adapters.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: API interaction is separated from business logic.
4. **Loose Coupling**: Interfaces are used to decouple components.
5. **Open/Closed Principle**: The architecture is open for extension (new adapters) but closed for modification.
6. **Composition over Inheritance**: The architecture uses composition to build complex behavior.
7. **Law of Demeter**: Components only interact with their immediate dependencies.
8. **Information Hiding**: Internal details of components are hidden behind interfaces.
